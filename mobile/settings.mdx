    2. Switch to new profile
    3. Verify connection works
    4. Then delete old profile
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backup credentials" icon="floppy-disk">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connection Indicator

The app shows connection status in the chat screen header:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Green Dot">
    **Status:** Connected
    **Meaning:** MQTT connection active, backend healthy
    **Action:** None needed
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Yellow Dot">
    **Status:** Reconnecting
    **Meaning:** Connection lost, attempting to reconnect
    **Action:** Wait 5-10 seconds for auto-reconnect
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Red Dot">
    **Status:** Disconnected
    **Meaning:** No connection to server
    **Action:** Check server is running, verify profile settings
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Backend Health Banner

If backend is connected but Claude Code client is disconnected, a yellow banner appears:

```
⚠️ Backend client disconnected - messages won't be processed
```

**Causes:**
- Claude Code CLI not running
- Backend started without `--auto` flag
- Claude Code crashed or was stopped

**Fix:** Start Claude Code on your server with `ccc start --auto`

  <Step title="Scroll to bottom of Settings">
    Find "Clear Cache" or "App Data" section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap Clear Cache">
    Confirmation modal appears
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm action">
    Cache is cleared immediately
  </Step>
  <Step title="App reloads">

### When to Clear Cache

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="App behaving strangely" icon="bug">
    Symptoms:
    - Messages not loading
    - Old sessions appearing
    - Stale data showing

    **Fix:** Clear cache to reset local state

### What Logout Does

Clears:
- All server profiles
- All projects
- All messages
- All cached data

       - SSL toggle matches server (http = OFF, https = ON)
       - Port is correct (default 3000)

    2. **Check backend:**
       - Run `ccc --status` on server
       - Ensure backend is running
       - Check firewall allows port

    3. **Test from browser:**
       - Visit `http://SERVER_URL/health`
       - Should return JSON with status
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Theme not changing" icon="palette">

## Privacy & Security

<Info>
CCC takes privacy and security seriously. Here's what you should know:
</Info>

### Data Storage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local Storage">
    **Stored on device:**
    - Projects list
    - Recent messages (cached)
    - Session metadata
    - App preferences

    **Location:** App's private directory (not accessible by other apps)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Secure Storage">
    **Stored in keychain/keystore:**
    - MQTT credentials
    - Server passwords
    - Terminal credentials

    **Security:** Hardware-encrypted, requires device unlock
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Not Stored">
    **Never stored:**
    - Claude API keys (on server only)
    - File contents (streamed, not cached)
    - Terminal command history (server-side)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Network Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MQTT Over WebSocket" icon="network-wired">
    All communication uses MQTT over WebSocket:
    - **Local:** ws:// (unencrypted, safe on private network)
    - **Remote:** wss:// (encrypted with TLS)

    Enable SSL in profile for remote connections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Cloud Storage" icon="cloud-slash">
    All data stays between your device and your server. Nothing is sent to third-party clouds or CCC servers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Optional Authentication" icon="user-lock">
    Backend supports MQTT authentication:
    - Username/password per profile
    - Credentials stored securely
    - Prevents unauthorized access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best Practices

<Tip>
**Use SSL for remote:** Always enable SSL when connecting via ngrok or public internet.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Strong MQTT passwords:** If using authentication, choose strong, unique passwords.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Device lock required:** Set a PIN/password/biometric on your device. This is required for secure credential storage.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Rooted/Jailbroken devices:** Secure keychain may be compromised. Avoid storing sensitive credentials on modified devices.
</Warning>
