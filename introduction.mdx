## What is CCC?

CCC (Claude Code Chat) is a mobile bridge that enables you to control [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) from your Android or iOS device. Chat with Claude, manage coding sessions, approve tool permissions, and access your development terminal—all from your phone or tablet.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** You need an active Claude Pro or Max subscription and Claude Code installed on your development machine.
</Info>

## How It Works

CCC consists of two components that work together:

    style D fill:#1A1A1A,stroke:#2A2A2A,color:#E5E5E5
```

### Backend Server

A lightweight Node.js CLI tool (`@naarang/ccc`) that runs on your development machine and:
- Creates an MQTT bridge between your mobile device and Claude Code
- Manages Claude Code process lifecycle and session persistence
- Intercepts tool permission requests for mobile approval
- Provides secure web-based terminal access
- Supports optional remote access via ngrok

### Mobile App

A native iOS/Android app built with React Native that provides:
- Real-time chat interface with streaming responses
- Session management (create, resume, switch conversations)
- Permission control system with 4 modes
- Multi-project support
- Terminal emulator
- Image attachment support
- Context usage monitoring

## Use Cases

### On-the-Go Coding

Ask Claude to implement features, fix bugs, or review code while you're away from your desk.

```bash
# You: "Add user authentication to the API endpoints"
# Claude: *analyzes code, implements JWT auth, updates tests*
```

### Code Review from Mobile

Review Claude's proposed changes on your phone before they're applied to your project.

```bash
# Claude requests permission to modify 5 files
# You review the changes on your phone → approve or deny
```

### Remote Terminal Access

Execute commands, check logs, or restart services from your terminal—no SSH or VPN required.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ git status
$ docker-compose logs
```

### Collaborative Debugging

Share your session with Claude while discussing issues with your team on Slack/Discord.

<Tip>
Use **Plan Mode** when you want Claude to analyze code and propose solutions without making any changes until you approve.
