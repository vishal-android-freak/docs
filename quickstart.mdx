## Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up CCC and having your first conversation with Claude in under 10 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Backend">
    On your development machine, start the CCC backend:

    ```bash
    ccc
    ```

    You'll see output showing the MQTT broker, router, and terminal server starting. **Copy the Server URL** shown in the output (e.g., `ws://192.168.1.100:8883/mqtt`).

    <Tip>
    Leave this terminal window open—the backend must keep running for the mobile app to connect.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Mobile App">
    Open the CCC app on your mobile device and complete the initial setup:

    ### First Launch
    1. **Onboarding**: Swipe through the 3-screen tutorial
    2. **Authentication**: Tap "Continue as Guest" (anonymous login)
    3. **Server Setup**: You'll see the "Create Server Profile" screen

    ### Configure Server Profile
    1. **Name**: Enter a name (e.g., "Home Dev Machine")
    2. **Server URL**: Paste the URL from backend output
       - Must start with `ws://` (or `wss://` for SSL)
       - Example: `ws://192.168.1.100:8883/mqtt`
    3. **Username/Password**: Leave blank (optional authentication)
    4. **SSL**: Leave disabled (unless using ngrok with SSL)
    5. Tap **"Save"** or **"Connect"**

    <Info>
    The connection indicator in the top-right should turn **green** if successful. If it stays red, see [troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting#connection-issues).
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Project">
    Now create a project to organize your coding sessions:

    1. Tap **"Create Project"** or the **"+" button**
    2. Fill in project details:
       - **Name**: "My First Project" (or any descriptive name)
       - **Description**: "Testing CCC" (optional)
       - **Directory Path**: Full path to your project folder
         - macOS/Linux example: `/Users/yourname/projects/myapp`
         - Windows example: `C:\Users\yourname\projects\myapp`
    3. Tap **"Create"**

    <Warning>
    The directory path must be **absolute** and must **exist** on your development machine. CCC will validate the path when you start chatting.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your First Chat">
    From the Projects screen, tap **"New Chat"** on your project card:

    1. The chat screen opens with an empty conversation
    2. Type your first message in the input field at the bottom
    3. Tap the **send button** (paper airplane icon)
    4. Watch Claude's response stream in real-time!

    ### Example First Messages

    <CodeGroup>
    ```text Simple Greeting
    Hello! Can you explain what this project does?
    ```

    ```text Request Help
    Can you help me add a new feature to handle user authentication?
    ```

    ```text Ask Questions
    What files are in the src/ directory and what do they do?
    ```

    ```text Code Generation
    Create a new React component called UserProfile.tsx with TypeScript
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve Tool Permissions">
    When Claude needs to use tools (read files, run commands, etc.), you'll see a permission modal:

    1. **Permission Request** modal appears
    2. Review what tool Claude wants to use and its parameters
    3. Choose an option:
       - **Approve**: Allow this one time
       - **Approve & Don't Ask Again**: Add to allowed tools list
       - **Deny**: Reject with optional reason

    <Tip>
    Use **"Approve & Don't Ask Again"** for tools you trust (like Read, Grep) to speed up interactions. You can always change this later in settings.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Effective CCC Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Plan Mode for unfamiliar code" icon="magnifying-glass">
    When working with a new codebase, switch to **Plan Mode** to have Claude analyze and propose changes without executing them. Review the plan, then approve or modify as needed.

    **Switch modes in mobile app**: Settings → Permission Mode → Plan
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create separate projects for different codebases" icon="folder-tree">
    Don't put all your work in one project. Create separate projects for:
    - Different applications/repos
    - Frontend vs backend
    - Personal vs work projects

    This keeps sessions organized and improves Claude's context understanding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor context usage" icon="chart-pie">
    The circular indicator in the chat header shows context usage (out of 200k tokens). When it gets high (>80%), consider:
    - Starting a new session
    - Clearing old messages
    - Being more concise in your requests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use images for design/UI questions" icon="image">
    Instead of describing UI bugs or design ideas in text, take a screenshot and send it to Claude with your question. Claude can see and analyze visual issues.

    **Tap the image+ button** in the chat input to attach photos.
