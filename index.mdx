## What is CCC?

CCC (Claude Code Chat) is a mobile IDE in the making that enables you to control [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (and other AI agents in the future) from your Android or iOS device. Chat with Claude, manage coding sessions, approve tool permissions, and access your development terminal—all from your phone or tablet.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** You need an active Claude Pro or Max subscription and Claude Code installed on your development machine.
